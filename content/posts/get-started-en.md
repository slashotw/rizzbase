This is the quick tutorial that teach how to deploy your own Notion blog using Buroguru.


## Step 1: Setting up database


Before deploying Buroguru, you'll need to prepare a Notion database to serve as your blog’s content source. You can either clone the [template](/21ad51c831448068b621f3b5def5dd2d?v=21ad51c8314480179bb6000cc439c73a) or create your own with following fields.


| Field Name    | Type          | Description                                                                                 |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Title`       | Title         | The title of the post.                                                                      |
| `id`          | Text          | The id of the post, also the url-slug of the blog. (e.g. `buruguru.zudo.cc/get-started-en`. |
| `Published`   | Checkbox      | Whether to publish.                                                                         |
| `Tags`        | Multi-select  | Category tags                                                                               |
| `Date`        | Date          | Just date that indicate the time your wrote the post.                                       |
| `Description` | Text          | Brief summary of the posts shown in preview.                                                |
| `Thumbnail`   | Files & media | Thumbnail image.                                                                            |


## Step 2: Setting up Notion Integration


To allow Buroguru to access your Notion database, you need to create a Notion Integration and get the access token.

1. Create new integration

	Go to [Notion Integration](https://www.notion.so/profile/integrations) and click ‘Add Integration’, select the workspace where your database is located, and give your integration a name like ‘blog’, the logo is not required.

2. Update the capabilities

	Click the new added integration, In the **Content Capabilities** section, at least toggle **Read content.**


	![image.png](/images/posts/98c28374-0e36-407d-8914-e6cf5c3eeb24.png)

3. Copy Notion token

	After creating it, you’ll see a field labeled **`Internal Integration Token`**. Copy this token, we’ll use it later.


	![image.png](/images/posts/8b026e71-cf53-4111-bfed-abd6b4fb0eb8.png)

4. Add connection

	Go back to the Notion database you create earlier in “full page”, click the three dots in the top right, then on the bottom, click **Connections** and select the integration just added.

	![image.png](/images/posts/9221f2db-a592-4232-9704-ea63a7792974.png)

5. Copy database id

	Click **Share** button on the top right, and click **Copy Link,** and you’ll get a link like [`https://www.notion.so/wusandwitch-notes/212d51c8314480ca8d4ffa62487XXXXXX?v=212d51c8314480a89fea000cXXXXXX&source=copy_link`](https://www.notion.so/wusandwitch-notes/212d51c8314480ca8d4ffa624873e734?v=212d51c8314480a89fea000c43f4e73f) .


	![image.png](/images/posts/6546a5d8-567d-49e7-b40b-989398726ea6.png)


	And the `Database ID` will be the first id (the one before `?`), the one in the example will be  [`212d51c8314480ca8d4ffa62487XXXXXX`](https://www.notion.so/wusandwitch-notes/212d51c8314480ca8d4ffa624873e734?v=212d51c8314480a89fea000c43f4e73f)```, and keep it, we'll also use it later.


## Step 3: Setting up repository and token


Once the Notion integration is ready, you can fork the Buroguru repository to your GitHub account and deploy your blog to Vercel in just a few clicks.

1. Fork the repository

	Go to [https://github.com/WuSandWitch/Buroguru](https://github.com/WuSandWitch/Buroguru) and click **Fork.**


	![image.png](/images/posts/0f465123-649d-43bd-a9d5-08197c94cf2e.png)


	Give the repository you like, like `WuSandWitch-Blog`

2. Configure Github Secrets /  Notion token

	After clone, go to **Setting**, and then **Secrets and variables**, go to **Action,** and add the “Repository Secrets”, by clicking **New repository secret.**

	![image.png](/images/posts/b1433895-545c-43d2-94ca-74d8d5ebfc5c.png)


	Now add two secret, one is `NOTION_TOKEN`, which is the Notion Integration token we just keep.


	![image.png](/images/posts/9959f563-06fe-49c5-af9d-527b740075bf.png)


	And another one is `NOTION_DATABASE_ID` which is the blog database id we just keep.

## Step 4: Deploy to Vercel


With your GitHub repository ready and secrets configured, it’s time to deploy your blog to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and go live with your Notion-powered blog!


After logging in, click **+ Add New Project**, then select your forked repo (e.g., `WuSandWitch-Blog`).

# Next Step


You can personalize your blog in config file, check [here](https://buroguru.zudo.cc/posts/config-guide-en).


# About Auto Updates


Once your blog is deployed, Buroguru will automatically sync content from your Notion database **every 12 hours** via GitHub Actions. The new posts will be published and redeployed without any manual steps.


If needed, you can also go to the **Actions tab in GitHub** and manually trigger the update workflow.
